Nowadays, with bad actors trying to compromise open-source projects en mass, it’s important to put aside the excitement about AI just long enough to make the right decisions. Introducing AI into your CI/CD system might sound fun but there are reasons why making the wrong choices will bite you and your organisation.

In this session, we’ll be looking at each of the top AI frameworks and assessing them under the cold light of day. We’ll look at their background, how (and on what) they are trained etc and generally try to assess accuracy and usefulness today and tomorrow.

 We’ll also look at which ones have good security, which ones follow great coding practices and even which ones pass the emerging open-source standards and legislation being developed for components and AI models by organisations like OWASP, OpenSSF and governments world wide

In AI, the best framework isn’t just smart, it’s the one that doesn’t outsmart your safety.
