Like all tools, AI can be used for good or for ill. AI, akin to any sharp instrument, can become dangerous if not wielded correctly. In our rush to achieve business differentiation, we may easily falterâ€”diminishing our security and, perhaps ultimately, jeopardizing our organizations. The immense pressure to integrate AI into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be balanced with a nuanced understanding of AI: recognizing the threats posed by malicious use, the risks of misuse by the uninformed, and the general challenges of AI implementation. This talk aims to assist Java developers tasked with incorporating AI into their applications by helping them understand the risks, challenges, and remedies available as they prepare to navigate the uncharted territories of this brave new world.
